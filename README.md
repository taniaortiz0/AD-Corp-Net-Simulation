I ran dsa.msc to manage Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) for users accounts, groups, and organizational units (OUs). I selected full control of permissions for the admin and use least privilege for the different departments and users.

I ran gpmc.msc and implemented security practices in the group policy management service. I updated the Password Policy such as minimum password length, password complexity, maximum password age, minimum password age, and enforce password history.

Additionally, I configured the Removable Storage Access to prevent access to USB drives. After the Group Policy Management has been configured, I ran gpupdate / force to apply the updates in an instance for these configurations. 

## üß± Firewall Rules

I ran wf.msc to apply firewall rules for Inbound/Outbound traffic using Microsoft Defender Firewall. The rules I applied for the firewall is specifically for DNS (Inbound/Outbound). 

- Created a new rule (Inbound/Outbound) from the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules
- Specified the port 53 (UDP)
- Allow the connection if it is secure
- For Inbound I selected Domain and Private and Outbound I selected all profiles (Domain, Private, and Public)
- I keep everything else as default and created the rules
